2. TESTING & DEBUGGING
Identifying a problem/Syntax errors

Crashes
Infinite loops

Music is based around Dance of the Reed Flutes. Simple piano version echoing the mistakes in
the music e.g. an infinite loop when the dancer is stuck in an infinite loop. On top of this we have 
computer error noises. Needs to be manually queued from Ash's nod.

Linked lists, trees, queues, stacks, search, sort etc.

Voronoi?

- deconstruction - start with complex vis, break into simpler pieces
- small multiples?
